# QualcommTempApp
Temperature Test App

App  generates a random list of temperatures in Celsius for five days (Mon-Fri) and display it in a list

Allows user (via button at top) to change the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit for each day, calculation done through JNI.

Also displays the phoneâ€™s ambient temperature via sensor at the top of the activity(if the phone has ambient temp. sensor)


** If you're unable to get JNI running, please make sure your CMakeLists path is set correctly in the gradle file in the external build **
